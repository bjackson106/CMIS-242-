# Intermediate Programming (CMIS 242)

## Environment

Most, if not all of my projects will be built with [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) which is open source.

I personally like developing on MacOS but the IDE is available on Windows as well.

I'm using [Java 12](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html)
