# Week 5 - Writing Recursive Methods
Provide a recursive definition of some sequence of numbers or function (e.g. log, exponent, polynomial). Choose one different from that of any posted thus far. Write a recursive method that given n, computes the nth term of that sequence. Also provide an equivalent iterative implementation. How do the two implementations compare?
